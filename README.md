### Gathering data on spam

I think spam is really weirdly interesting, and I've set up a gmail account that
I've plastered all over the internet, with the hopes that people (or robots)
send me spam. (You can do it too! spamkerch@gmail.com)

These are the scripts I'm going to use to collect data from all the spam I get.
It's a work in progress. Stay tuned!
